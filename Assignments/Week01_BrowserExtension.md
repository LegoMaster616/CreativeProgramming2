BROWSER EXTENSION
====

### DUE: THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 1 

For our first project of the semester, we'll use Javascript (and the popular [JQuery](http://www.jquery.com) library) to create browser extensions. An extension is a bit of code that, as the name implies, extends or augments websites. Like many things with code, while most extensions are useful tools they can also be used for creative, activist, absurd, and aesthetic purposes. In this way, they're very much like an intervention into an existing system, a way of working that has ties in art history going back to the 1950s. Guy Debord, of the group Situationist International, argued that radio and TV, driven by capitalism, made people passive recipients of [spectacle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Society_of_the_Spectacle) instead of actively engaging with their surroundings. Debord called for [détournement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9tournement), which can be thought of as hacking pre-computer. Satire, grafitti, and remix are similar forms of making that engage existing systems, transforming them into something more than their inputs.

Your assignment is to build an extension whose purpose is art, not function. It should be an intervention that happens inside the browser. Think about what items exist to be manipulated and what actions can be performed on them: swapping, removing, or adding content. The result should be something that is visually or conceptually interesting that plays with these ideas.

While extensions can be technically complex, yours should be activated automatically with a single click of its button. Options for how the extension behaves, what can be transformed, and other technical resources are covered in the [tutorial code](https://github.com/jeffThompson/CreativeProgramming2/tree/master/Code/Week01_BrowserExtension).

### DELIVERABLES  
Your finished project should include the following:

* Project sketches, either scanned or photographed  
* README file explaining what your extension does and what is in the code repo  
* Finished browser extension code, including an icon and update manifest file  
* At least three screenshots  
* Optional: if your extension is animated, or is interactive, capture a video of it being run and upload to YouTube or Vimeo (we'll talk more about this in a few weeks)  

### FOR THURSDAY, JANUARY 25  
This semester, we'll be focusing on the development of project ideas, both as a way to work through more complex projects and to begin developing a sense of a personal creative practice. To this end, you'll be doing drawings in your sketchbook. ["Paper prototyping"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping) like this is much quicker than going straight to code, and leaves a record of your process.

For next week, please draw at least ten sketches of what your extension might do. These can be quick and rough, but should give a sense of the extension's actions. Feel free to annotate with notes, detail drawings, etc. Be sure to draw large enough so we can see them – don't be afraid to use up paper!

Once you've settled on an idea, start trying to implement it in Javascript. You should have at least a rough, working extension for next week. If you can't figure out any particular details, leave notes in your code and we'll solve them next week. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is also a really great resource for Javascript – chances are, someone has had the same question as you!


### FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 1  
For next week, your assignment is to finish your extension and document it. When finished, take at least three screenshots of pages transformed by your extension. Try to capture the essence of what your extension does so that people can understand it without a lot of explanation. (Of course, if it's complicated or conceptual, a description might be necessary.)

Create a `README` file, if you haven't already, and write a short description of your project: what the extension does, what files are in the repository, and any other info you might want to include.

To turn everything in, do a final push to your project's Github repo. Upload a screenshot of your extension to Canvas and include a link to your repo in the comments.

Optionally, if you'd like to deploy your extension to the Chrome Store for download by others, you can find a link to instructions in the tutorial code. Let me know if you take yours live!

* Robert Rauschenberg's [*Erased de Kooning Drawing*](https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/98.298)  
* [The Yes Men](http://theyesmen.org) create work that combines art, activism, and hijinks to talk about social issues – notable projects include a [very believable issue of the New York Times](http://theyesmen.org/index.php/portfolio_page/nyt-special-edition/) and a [fake NRA press conference](http://theyesmen.org/index.php/portfolio_page/share-the-safety/)  
* Franci Alÿs' [*The Leak*](http://francisalys.com/the-leak/)

* Aram Bartholl's [*Greenscreen Arnsberg*](https://arambartholl.com/greenscreen-projects-eng.html) and [*Dead Drops*](http://deaddrops.com/)  
* Street skateboarding can be thought of as an intervention too – see [Rodney Mullen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olv1tqGmDdo) and [Gou Miyagi](https://youtu.be/pk8dy4NIzBU), or much later [David Hafsteinsson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHM4cZWjClc) and [Ritchie Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gXpZmQ7j70), and Iain Borden's essay *Another Pavement, Another Beach: Skateboarding and the Performative Critique of Architecture* in this week's `Readings` folder  

### EXTENSIONS SHOWN  
A selection of (mostly) artistic takes on the browser extension, divided by category:

**TRANSFORMATION** 
* Leon Eckert's [*Opinions Are My Own*](http://leoneckert.com/projects/opinions-are-my-own/) obscures and translates social media posts to hide content from Facebook  
* Rafaël Rozendaal's [*Abstract Browsing*](http://www.abstractbrowsing.net/) turns everything into colored blocks

* The Daily Show's [*Make Trump Tweet Eight Again*](http://maketrumptweetseightagain.com) changes the font of Trump tweets to look like they were written in crayon

**REMOVAL/DELETION**  
* Rafaël Rozendaal and Jonas Lund's [*Text Free Browsing*](http://textfreebrowsing.com/) removes all text from a website
